Marvin provides common tools and structure for services being built on Google App Engine by leaning heavily on the [go-kit/kit/transport/http package](http://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/transport/http). The [service interface here](http://godoc.org/github.com/NYTimes/marvin#Service) is very similar to the service interface in [NYT's gizmo/server/kit package](https://godoc.org/github.com/NYTimes/gizmo/server/kit#Service) so teams can build very similar looking software but use vasty different styles of infrastructure.

Marvin has been built to work with Go 1.8, which is available on App Engine Standard.
